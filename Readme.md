# Bangla Sign Language Detection Using Image Processing

## Abstract
Sign language is a process of communication using visual gestures including facial expressions, postures of the body, and signs which are used by hearing and speech-impaired people. The principal objective of our paper is to support those hearing-impaired people and mitigate their everyday life. Bengali sign language hasn't received much attention despite the fact that there have been a lot of contributions about sign language interpretation using computer vision. Additionally, the lack of resources, particularly for Bengali sign language, has made it difficult to work on this subject. So, We have created a sign language dataset of frequently used Bengali terms and created a machine learning model to assess the dataset's quality. Our method involves creating, cleaning, enhancing, analyzing, and feeding renowned ML models for evaluation. We have provided step-by-step solutions and analyses, and through comparison, we have demonstrated that our strategy produces State-of-the-art results. We anticipate that the neophyte researcher in this subject will find our dataset to be an invaluable resource, and our given algorithm will serve as a foundation for future contributions and improvements.
