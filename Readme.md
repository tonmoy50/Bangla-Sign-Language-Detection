# Bangla Sign Language Detection Using Image Processing

## Abstract
Sign language is a process of communication using visual gestures including facial expressions, postures of the body and signs which are used by hearing and speech impaired people. The principal objective of our paper is to support those hearing-impaired people and mitigate their everyday life. In this paper, we created a Bengali sign language dataset and described a module which has a design for seven number of automatic translations of Bengali Sign language into Bengali speech. It can be utilized as a translator to avoid the intervention of an intermediate person and allow them to communicate in an obvious way. It is predominantly an application program developed using an image processing algorithm. The images of Sign language gestures are captured using a webcam and an inbuilt camera of any device. Other vision analysis functions are performed in the Operating System. Speeches are provided as the output through an inbuilt audio device and speaker.
